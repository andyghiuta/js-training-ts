/*
Given an array of scrabble tiles, create a function
that outputs the maximum possible score a player can achieve
by summing up the total number of points for all the tiles in their hand.
Each hand contains 7 scrabble tiles.

Here's an example hand:

[
  { tile: "N", score: 1 },
  { tile: "K", score: 5 },
  { tile: "Z", score: 10 },
  { tile: "X", score: 8 },
  { tile: "D", score: 2 },
  { tile: "A", score: 1 },
  { tile: "E", score: 1 }
]
The players maximumScore from playing all these tiles would be
1 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1, or 28.
*/

export default function maximumScore() {

}
