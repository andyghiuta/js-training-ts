Student catalog

Given list of students, each having "id", "name", "score" and "section" properties, find:
- how many students are per section
- the score of the student with given id
- the student with the highest score
- the average score per section

Note: Avoid looping the list for each of the requirements

EG:
const students = [
  {id: 1, name: "John Doe", score: 8, section: "B"},
  {id: 2, name: "Jane Doe", score: 7, section: "A"},
  {id: 3, name: "Steve Doe", score: 9.5, section: "A"},
  {id: 4, name: "Novac Doe", score: 5, section: "B"},
  {id: 5, name: "Selena Doe", score: 9.9, section: "C"},
  {id: 6, name: "Raphael Doe", score: 8, section: "B"},
  {id: 7, name: "Simona Doe", score: 10, section: "C"},
]

getAnswers(students) => {
  studentsPerSection: {
    A: 2,
    B: 3,
    C: 2
  },
  score: 5,
  highest: {id: 7, name: "Simona Doe", score: 10 section: "C"},
  average: {
    A: 8.25,
    B: 7,
    C: 9.95
  }
}
