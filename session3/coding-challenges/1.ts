/*
Fibonacci numbers

A. Write a function fib(n) that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.

The sequence of Fibonacci numbers has the formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2.
In other words, the next number is a sum of the two preceding ones.

B. Improve the fib function by remebering the already computed numbers
so they are not calculated on a second use
